# parkinson's detection from voice

## purpose
record a person's audio, analyze some features from it, and using your trained model, predict parkinson's risk

## core features
- record audio using streamlit
- clean the audio (remove silences)
- using our model, predict the risk

## model training
- linear regression, bad, need to go for distinct 0 or 1
- logistic regression, 1000 iterations, testing
